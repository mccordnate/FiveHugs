FiveHugs
========

An App created at Facebook's Midwest Regional Hackathon 2013

Summary: I created FiveHugs in order for people to find awesome things going on locally. The app integrates a Facebook login to start. After logging in, the user is shown a list of posts nearest to where they are geographically located at the moment. A user can create a post which will store the users current geographic location upon creation. Think of it like dropping a note behind where you left it. Users can either hug or high five the post depending on whether they thought it was awesome or the person needed some sympathy.

Working functions:

-List of posts nearest to you
-Compose post functionality
-Posts displayed with user's Facebook name, hug and high five buttons.

Half-completed functions:
-Was able to get list for sorting posts by a specific mileage but couldn't get the settings to change it working (not shown in current upload)
-Profile picture pulling. Started to implement but had issues with pulling the picture from Facebook on the main running thread
-Keeping track of how many hugs or high fives a post received

Uncompleted functions:
-Search locations
-Search specific user's posts
-Hug/five rankings
